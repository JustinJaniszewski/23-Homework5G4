# FFT

The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm for computing the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. The DFT is a mathematical transformation that converts a sequence of complex numbers (such as a signal in the time domain) into another sequence of complex numbers (its representation in the frequency domain).
